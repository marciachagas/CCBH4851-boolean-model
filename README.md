In this repository are:

  - the CCBH-2022 in csv format (CCBH-2022.csv),
  - the python code to generate the input file for the ASSA-PBN software (GRN_to_ASSA.py),
  - the python code to compute conserved genes in last n time steps (find_basin.py),
  - the text containing detailed instructions and command lines (commands.txt).
  - Normalized RNA-seq data, generated by Felicita Mabel (norm.zip);
  - Binarized gene data from the core subnetwork (genes-bin.zip);
  - Simulation trajectory results and attraction basins (sim.zip). For enhanced folder navigation, it is important to read the README file contained within it.
